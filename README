Structure of Program:
File organization: rectangle.cpp
Functional organization: Main() takes input of string of x, y, length and width of rectangle 1 and rectangle 2. Then puts x and y into point class and puts point into rectangle class object.

Status: Incomplete, could not figure out how to do operator overload. Was unsure if needed to use module for % or do whatever needed and not use modulo.

Hardware & platform I used: Intel core i7 with 16GB RAM MacOS

Compile: extract the archive and then from shell run "make". This will create executable hw2 and then run ./hw3
